# Simple L-system exporter
This is a modification of the simple L-system "tree" generator by Daniel Shiffman (link below)
https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/blob/main/CodingChallenges/CC_016_LSystem/Processing/CC_016_LSystem/CC_016_LSystem.pde

I added the option to export your generated L-system as a .png with transparent background. Feel free to use these images for whatever purpose you want to.
This code is placed under the MIT license, as was the original one by Dan Shiffman.

**Controls**

Right click to generate a new iteration. The code limits you to 5 iterations, but this limit can easily be changed at the top of the code (though further iterations can take quite a lot of time to render, or break the appearance of your tree completely depending on the angledeg variable).

Spacebar to save. Your images will appear in the same folder as the .pde. Keep in mind the .pde needs to be in a folder with the same name as itself in order to work.
